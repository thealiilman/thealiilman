# Hallo! ðŸ¤“

I'm a software engineer and speaker. I work mainly with JavaScript, React.js, Ruby and Ruby on Rails whilst specialising in back-end engineering. I am returning to work in 2023 after a little over a year on sabbatical.

I've 3 years of professional experience. Throughout my career so far, I've worked on 11 projects of various sizes, including [Oslo Mikrobuldreri](https://www.oslomikrobuldreri.no/), a self-serving indoor rock-climbing gym in Oslo, and the currently inactive [AirAsia Activities](https://www.airasia.com/activities/), an activity trip planner platform.

I am a lively and confident individual. I mix along well with people of various personalities and backgrounds.
