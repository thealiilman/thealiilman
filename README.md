# Assalamualaikum! Hello! Hallo! Dober dan! Hej! ðŸ¤“

A seasoned software engineer known for taking extreme ownership of projects and working closely with teams to deliver results. Before joining IKHLAS, I was involved in 11 projects of various sizes â€” including [Oslo Mikrobuldreri](https://www.oslomikrobuldreri.no/), a self-serving indoor rock-climbing gym in Oslo, and AirAsia Activities, an activity trip planner platform. I have been working remotely since joining IKHLAS.

I work mainly using Next.js these days whilst also exploring the Elixir ecosystem â€” in the past, I have used Ruby on Rails to build full-stack applications.

When Iâ€™m not writing code, one can find me out on a field somewhere â€“ barefooted â€“ with a book in hand whilst the sun is shining upon my head.

I have been walking the path less travelled. I was homeschooled from the age of 10 until 16. My journey into programming started when I was 13, writing my first JavaScript code on a platform called KhanAcademy, but I became frustrated due to the tutorials requiring me to draw shapes. But my interest in programming never waned; I was fascinated by what one can do with code. Afterwards, I found out about Codecademy. Long story short, programming became more than just a hobby.

Fast forward to 2025, I can say that not following the crowd doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s a bad thing. Everyone has their own adventure!
