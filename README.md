# Hallo! ðŸ¤“

I'm Ali, a 19-year-old software engineer and speaker. I work mainly with JavaScript, React.js, Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Other than these technologies, I'm getting my hands dirty with Docker, Kubernetes and serverless.

I develop back-ends by applying TDD and using SOLID principles as a guide, ensuring isolation of business logic and ease of writing tests.

I've 2 years of professional experience, and I've been working for a digital agency called [Suria Labs](https://surialabs.com) since January 2018. Throughout the past 2 years, I've worked on 8 internal and client projects, including [smec.io](https://smec.io) and [AirAsia Deals](https://airasia.com/deals).

### Notable achievements
- I was involved in the integration of AirAsia's order management system into AirAsia Deals. I was responsible for creating a webhook that updates the payment and sends emails for successful / unsuccessful payments.

- I updated the process of redeeming BIG Points on AirAsia Deals by moving the APIs from Node.js to Rails and rewriting certain parts of BIG Points redemption in the front-end.

- I rapidly fixed a high-priority bug on AirAsia Deals when we were chasing a deadline. This bug was preventing us from making a payment with a non-MYR currency. This is a notable achievement for me because I was initially brought onto the project to fix this bug and **I was unfamiliar with the codebase**.

- I wrote a _partner category importer_ on [AirAsia Activities](https://airasia.com/activities). The _partner category importer_ imports categories from Viator, one of the activity providers on AirAsia Activities. These categories are then matched to our own categories, which gives us the ability to auto-assign categories to certain activities whenever we import activities from Viator.

- And more to follow!

### My journey
I was homeschooled from the age of 10 until 16. I first dived into programming at the age of 13, writing my first JavaScript code on KhanAcademy.
